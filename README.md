# Sierpinski Triangle

## Motivation

Originally a project I attempted in C++ but with little luck, this is a
small project that helped me learn more about the image-rs crate while
refreshing my memory about the Rust syntax.

## Prerequisites

- Cargo install
- Rustc and Rust installed

## Program Compilation and Execution

Simply run the command: `cargo run`

## Resources

- [Sierpinski Triangle Wiki]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle")
- [image-rs GitHub]("https://github.com/image-rs/image")
- [image-rs official docs]("https://lib.rs/crates/image")

## Future Goals

While I have accomplished my initial goal listed in the Motivation section,
some future goals would be:

- Add ability to specify image size
- specify amount of iterations
- Possible display of the image being created using Piston or another graphics library
